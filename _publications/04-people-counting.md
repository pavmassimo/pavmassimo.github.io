Abstract. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) allows to move the intelligence processing as close as possible to where data are generated, hence reducing the latency with which a decision is made and being able to process data even when remote connection is scarce or absent. In this technological scenario, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data represent a new and challenging source of data providing relevant information, while guaranteeing the privacy of users. This paper introduces a novel TinyML solution able to count the number of people in a given area by processing UWB radar data. This novel solution was carefully designed to guarantee a high counting accuracy, while reducing the memory and computational demand so as to be executed on tiny devices. Experimental results on a real-world UWB radar dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
