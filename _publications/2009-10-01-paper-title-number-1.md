Abstract â€” Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is a novel research area aiming at designing machine and deep learning models and algorithms able to be executed on tiny devices such as Internet-of-Things units, edge devices or embedded systems. 
In this paper we introduce, for the first time in the literature, a TinyML solution for presence-detection based on UltrawideBand (UWB) radar, which is a particularly promising radar technology for pervasive systems.
To achieve this goal we introduce a novel family of tiny convolutional neural networks for the processing of UWB-radar data characterized by a reduced memory footprint and computational demand so as to satisfy the severe technological constraints of tiny devices. From this technological perspective, UWB-radars are particularly relevant in the presence-detection scenario since they do not acquire sensitive information of users (e.g., images, videos or audio), hence preserving their privacy.

The proposed solution has been successfully tested on a public-available benchmark for the indoor presence detection and on a real-world application of in-car presence detection.
