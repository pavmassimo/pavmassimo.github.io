Hi there! I'm  Massimo, a Ph.D. student in Information Technology at Politecnico di Milano. I'm a proud member of the AI-Tech-Research-Lab there. 

My research concentrates on Tiny Machine Learning, and in particular on enabling On-device Learning on IoT and heavily constrained Devices. I'm also collaborating with Truesense s.r.l. on applications of TinyML for UWB-radar. 

When I'm not working, I'm usually cooking, reading or playing boardgames.
